# StringT - An Interactive Journey into String Theory

**Live Demo:** [https://GeekNeuron.github.io/StringT/](https://GeekNeuron.github.io/StringT/)

**StringT** is a bilingual (English/Persian) educational web experience designed to introduce the core concepts of String Theory in a casual, engaging, and visually appealing way. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, optimized for hosting on GitHub Pages.

## Features

* **Interactive Exploration:** Navigate through fundamental ideas of String Theory step-by-step.
* **Bilingual Content:** Full support for English and Persian languages.
* **Modern Design:** Clean, responsive interface inspired by contemporary web aesthetics (e.g., isega.ro).
* **Client-Side:** Runs entirely in the browser, no backend required.
* **Educational Focus:** Aims to make complex topics more accessible to a general audience.

## Content Overview (Simplified)

The experience covers the following key areas of String Theory at an introductory level:

1.  **What's the Problem?**: Limitations of the Standard Model and General Relativity.
2.  **The Big Idea**: Particles as tiny vibrating strings.
3.  **Beyond Our Dimensions**: The need for extra spatial dimensions.
4.  **A Family of Theories**: Briefly touching upon different types of String Theories.
5.  **M-Theory**: The search for a unified "theory of everything."
6.  **Branes and Beyond**: Introducing higher-dimensional objects (branes).
7.  **The Landscape & Challenges**: Current status, open questions, and the "cosmic landscape."

## How to Use / Navigate

* Open the [live demo link](https://GeekNeuron.github.io/StringT/).
* Use the language switcher to select your preferred language (English/Persian).
* Navigate through the sections using the provided "Next" and "Previous" buttons or other interactive elements.

## Development

The project is structured into three main files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML structure, containing all the content sections.
* `style.css`: Handles all the styling, layout, animations, and responsive design.
* `script.js`: Manages interactivity, language switching, and dynamic behaviors.

### Contributing
